## About me

Hi! I’m Wonduk Seo, an AI researcher at Enhans AI and a graduate of Peking University (Bachelor in Information Management, Big Data Management & Application). I’m passionate about bridging human values, reasoning, and real-world AI systems through scalable, interpretable methods.

## Research Interests

- **Socially Responsible and Interpretable AI:** Advancing interpretability, consistency, and accountability in LLMs for socially impactful, privacy-aware, and ethically aligned applications.
- **Human Alignment and Evaluation:** Designing structured evaluation strategies, retrieval-augmented frameworks, and human-in-the-loop systems to align LLM behavior with human expectations.
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning and Interaction:** Leveraging collaborative agent architectures for reasoning, prompt optimization, and interpretable decision-making in large-scale AI systems.
