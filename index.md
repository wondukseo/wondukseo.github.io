## About Me

Hi! I’m Wonduk Seo, an AI Research Scientist at <a class="about-link" href="https://www.enhans.ai/" target="_blank">Enhans AI</a> since January 2025 and a 2025 graduate of Peking University (Bachelor in Information Management, Big Data Management &amp; Application). Previously, I was advised by <a class="about-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSUm6ikAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Yi Bu</a> at Peking University. I’m passionate about building scalable, transparent, and interpretable methods that keep LLMs grounded in human values, sustain behavioral consistency, and mitigate hallucinations in real-world deployments.

## Research Interests

- **Socially Responsible, Interpretable, and Aligned AI:** Advancing interpretability and accuracy in LLMs through transparent evaluation, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and feedback loop to ensure socially beneficial and context-aware behavior.
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning and Interaction:** Developing collaborative agent architectures that support reasoning, prompt optimization, and hallucination reduction while enabling interpretable decision-making at scale.
- **Information Retrieval with LLMs:** Designing adaptive query reformulation and expansion pipelines that capture nuanced intent and orchestrate multiple retrieval strategies for precise, transparent access to information.
- **Evidence Inheritance in LLM Pipelines:** Developing methods to track how external evidence is inherited, transformed, and selectively used across multi-stage LLM systems, so that provenance remains interpretable and trustworthy. My interest in LLM post-training to improve evidence grounding, calibration, and traceable reasoning complements this theme.
