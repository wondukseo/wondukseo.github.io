## About Me

Hi! I’m Wonduk Seo, an AI researcher at <a class="about-link" href="https://www.enhans.ai/" target="_blank">Enhans AI</a> since January 2025 and a graduate of Peking University (Bachelor in Information Management, Big Data Management &amp; Application). Previously, I was advised by <a class="about-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSUm6ikAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Yi Bu</a> at Peking University. I’m passionate about bridging human values, reasoning, and real-world AI systems through scalable, interpretable methods that maintain LLM consistency and reduce hallucinations in high-stakes settings.

## Research Interests

- **Socially Responsible and Interpretable AI:** Advancing interpretability and accuracy in large language models (LLMs) to ensure their use is consistent with social benefit, ethical standards, and real-world needs.
- **Human Alignment and Interpretability:** Developing interpretability and feedback frameworks that combine retrieval-augmented reasoning, transparent evaluation, and human-in-the-loop refinement to align LLM behavior with subtle and context-dependent human expectations.
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning and Interaction:** Developing collaborative agent architectures that support reasoning and prompt optimization while enabling interpretable decision-making in large-scale AI systems.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Query Understanding:** Exploring adaptive query expansion and reformulation strategies that bridge user intent with context-aware retrieval, improving both semantic precision and the transparency of information access in real-world retrieval systems.
