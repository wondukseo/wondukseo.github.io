## About me

Hi! I’m Wonduk Seo, an AI researcher at <a class="about-link" href="https://www.enhans.ai/" target="_blank">Enhans AI</a> since January 2025 and a graduate of Peking University (Bachelor in Information Management, Big Data Management &amp; Application). Previously, I was advised by <a class="about-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSUm6ikAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Yi Bu</a> at Peking University. I’m passionate about bridging human values, reasoning, and real-world AI systems through scalable, interpretable methods.

## Research Interests

- **Socially Responsible and Interpretable AI:** Advancing interpretability, consistency, and accountability in LLMs for socially impactful, privacy-aware, and ethically aligned applications.
- **Human Alignment and Evaluation:** Designing structured evaluation strategies, retrieval-augmented frameworks, and human-in-the-loop systems to align LLM behavior with human expectations.
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning and Interaction:** Leveraging collaborative agent architectures for reasoning, prompt optimization, and interpretable decision-making in large-scale AI systems.
